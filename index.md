Hi! I am a first year PhD student in the [Department of Cognitive Science] at Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Colin Wilson]. My interests are in computational linguistics and computational cognitive science-- how can we build computational models that represent and process language in more human-like ways?

Before coming to JHU, I completed a B.A. in Cognitive Science and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley. While there, I worked with Gašper Beguš studying phonological representations in generative adversarial networks trained on speech data.

See a copy of my CV [here](assets/pdf/CV.pdf).
