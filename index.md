Hi! My name is Alan, and I'm an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley graduating in December 2021 with a dual bachelor's in Computer Science and Cognitive Science. I am interested in the relationship between language and cognition, and in computational models of both. More specifically, I am interested in using insights from linguistics and neuroscience to build and interpret computational models of language, and leveraging insights from these models to better understand how humans acquire and use language. 

Currently, I'm fortunate to be part of the Berkeley Speech and Computation Lab, working with Dr. Gašper Beguš on multiple projects involving generative adversarial networks trained on speech data. Before that, I was graciously mentored by Dr. Taka'aki Taira for a data science project creating a seismological stress map of Northern California.
