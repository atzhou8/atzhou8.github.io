Hi! I am a third year PhD student in the [Department of Cognitive Science](https://cogsci.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Colin Wilson](https://colincwilson.github.io/). My interests are in computational linguistics and computational cognitive science-- how can we build computational models that represent and process language in more human-like ways?

Before coming to JHU, I completed a B.A. in Cognitive Science and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley. While there, I was fortunate to work with [Gašper Beguš](https://gbegus.github.io/) studying phonological representations in generative adversarial networks trained on speech data.
