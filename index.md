Hi! I am a third year PhD student in the [Department of Cognitive Science](https://cogsci.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins University, working with [John Hale](https://cogsci.jhu.edu/directory/john-t-hale/) by [Colin Wilson](https://cogsci.jhu.edu/directory/colin-wilson/). I am broadly interested in computational linguistics and neurolinguistics. Formally, what sort of computational system is language? How can these computational principles be implemented in both artificial and biological neural systems?git

Before coming to JHU, I completed a B.A. in Cognitive Science and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley. While there, I was fortunate to work with [Gašper Beguš](https://gbegus.github.io/) studying phonological representations in generative adversarial networks trained on speech data.
